TODO:
- Timestamp plantings for event enforcement
- Event logic interface
- Event classes
- Event enforcement UX (mark target tree, change Complete Turn to Impose Event, allow +1 plantings)
- Planting enforcement (only allow one planting per turn unless event allows otherwise)
- End game when all lands are full and current player cannot replace a tree
- Implement two-player mode
